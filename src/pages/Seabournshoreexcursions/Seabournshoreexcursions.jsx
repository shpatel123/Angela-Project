                                guided sightseeing tours and cultural experiences to active adventures, private
                                experiences and expedition activities.

                                For travelers sailing on Seabourn's traditional ocean and small-ship
                                itineraries, excursions can provide a deeper look at the destinations on the
                                itinerary. For expedition voyages aboard Seabourn Venture and Seabourn
                                Pursuit, the experience becomes more immersive, with activities such as
                                Zodiac exploration, wildlife observation, kayaking and guided landings.
                                Seabourn also offers Ventures by Seabourn, a collection of more immersive
                                and active experiences designed to take travelers deeper into the
                                destination.

                            Don't book every available excursion. Instead, create a balance. Cruising can
                            become exhausting if every port involves a six- or eight-hour tour — leave room
                            to enjoy the ship.

                            Should you book excursions in every port? No. One of the advantages of Seabourn
                            is that the ship itself is part of the experience. Some ports may be worth
                            exploring extensively. Others may be better suited to a relaxed morning followed
                            by an afternoon onboard.

                            Seabourn's shore excursions provide considerably more choice than simply
                            booking a standard guided tour. The program ranges from classic sightseeing
                            and culinary experiences to Ventures by Seabourn and expedition activities
                            involving Zodiacs, kayaking, wildlife and remote landings.
                        </p>
                        <p className="Sbc-p">
                            The best excursion isn't necessarily the longest or most expensive. It's the
                            one that matches how you want to experience the destination. For a first-time
                            visitor, a traditional guided excursion can provide an efficient introduction.
                            For an adventurous traveler, Ventures can provide a more active perspective.
                            For expedition travelers aboard Seabourn Venture or Seabourn Pursuit, Zodiac
                            operations, wildlife encounters and shore landings can become the centerpiece
                            of the voyage.
