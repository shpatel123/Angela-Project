                                Rather than simply visiting a port and returning to the ship, Seabourn's expedition program is designed around discovery. Guests can explore remote coastlines, observe wildlife, hike through pristine landscapes, kayak in protected waters and learn from expedition specialists who accompany the voyage.

                                The answer varies dramatically by itinerary. Some activities are relatively easy; others may require walking over uneven ground, getting in and out of Zodiacs, hiking, standing for extended periods or navigating wet or slippery surfaces.

                            Seabourn expedition cruises are best understood as luxury exploration rather than adventure cruising alone. The experience combines purpose-built expedition ships, luxury suites, private verandas, expert expedition teams, Zodiacs, kayaking, wildlife encounters, remote destinations, fine dining and personalized service.

                            The two ships — Seabourn Venture and Seabourn Pursuit — provide the platform for exploring some of the world's most remarkable environments. The biggest thing to remember is that expedition cruising is inherently unpredictable, and that's precisely what makes an expedition different from an ordinary cruise.
