                    <p>
                        Scenic and Tauck are two of the strongest choices
                        for travelers comparing luxury river cruises in
                        Europe. Both emphasize high levels of inclusion,
                        premium accommodations, attentive service,
                        destination experiences, and a relatively intimate
                        river-cruise environment. But they are not
                        identical.

                                and suite to be a major part of the
