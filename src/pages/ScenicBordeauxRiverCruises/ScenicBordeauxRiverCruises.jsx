                        A Scenic Bordeaux River Cruise is one of the best
                        ways to explore southwestern France if your ideal
                        luxury vacation revolves around wine, gastronomy,
                        history, countryside, and beautiful French towns.
                        Bordeaux is more than a city — it is the gateway to
                        one of the world's most celebrated wine regions,
                        and a river cruise allows travelers to explore that
                        region without repeatedly changing hotels.

                            the Dordogne River, Saint-Émilion, Médoc, French
                            wine estates, historic villages, vineyards,

                            appeal is obvious — you can experience
                            Bordeaux's wine country while using a luxury
                            river ship as your home base.
