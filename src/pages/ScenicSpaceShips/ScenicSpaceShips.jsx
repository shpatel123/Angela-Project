                        One of the most recognizable features of a Scenic
                        Space-Ship is its innovative balcony design. Instead
                        of a conventional balcony that simply extends
                        outside the cabin, many Scenic suites feature a Sun
                        Lounge — an enclosed or partially enclosed balcony
                        area that can be incorporated into the living space
                        of the suite.

                            For travelers researching Scenic River Cruises,
                            understanding this design is important because
                            the balcony isn't simply a cosmetic feature. It
                            can affect how much usable living space you
                            have, how you experience the river, your
                            privacy, your ability to enjoy the scenery, and
                            which suite category makes sense for your
                            budget. This guide explains what Scenic
                            Space-Ships are, how Sun Lounge balconies work,
