                        The Rhine is one of Europe's most iconic rivers — and
                        one of the best ways to experience it is from a
                        luxury river cruise. A Scenic Rhine River Cruise
                        combines historic cities, medieval villages,
                        vineyards, castles, and spectacular river scenery
                        with Scenic's all-inclusive luxury cruise experience.

                            Depending on the itinerary, you can wake up in
                            one European city and spend the afternoon
                            exploring another without packing and unpacking
                            your suitcase. For travelers considering Scenic,
                            the Rhine is particularly attractive because it
                            offers a remarkable variety of experiences in a
                            relatively compact region. This guide explains
                            where Scenic Rhine cruises go, which itineraries
                            are best, what you'll see, when to travel, which
                            excursions to consider, and how to choose the
                            right Scenic Rhine sailing.

                                attractions. The river corridor is lined
