                                The Mediterranean combines ancient cities, historic ports, islands, beaches, archaeological sites, renowned cuisine and distinctive cultures. But the appeal of a Seabourn itinerary is not simply how many destinations you can visit.

                                Seabourn's smaller luxury ships can create opportunities to experience lesser-known ports and smaller coastal destinations alongside major Mediterranean highlights. Depending on the itinerary, travelers may explore destinations across Italy, Greece, Croatia, France, Spain, Turkey and other Mediterranean regions, with itineraries varying by season and year.

                            Seabourn Mediterranean cruises are an excellent choice for travelers who want to explore the Mediterranean without sacrificing intimacy, luxury or personalized service. The region's combination of ancient history, beautiful islands, small ports, cuisine, wine, beaches and cultural experiences provides extraordinary variety.

                            Seabourn adds a smaller-ship environment and the opportunity to experience destinations at a more relaxed pace. For travelers who would rather spend the afternoon exploring a historic village or enjoying a quiet Mediterranean harbor than participating in a large-ship entertainment program, Seabourn offers a compelling alternative.
