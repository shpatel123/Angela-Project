                        Cruises from many other European river cruise lines
                        is its emphasis on personalized service. For guests
                        staying in eligible suites, Scenic Butler Service
                        adds another layer of convenience to the cruise

                            when you need assistance, your butler can help

                            which suites receive it, what your butler can
                            help with, and whether upgrading to a
                            butler-serviced suite is worth the additional
                            cost.
