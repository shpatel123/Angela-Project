                    <p>
                        Scenic and Riverside Luxury Cruises are both compelling choices for travelers looking for an upscale European river cruise, but they deliver luxury in different ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scenic has built its river-cruise identity around an ultra-luxury, highly inclusive experience, with purpose-built Space-Ships, personalized service, spacious suites, and included experiences. Scenic's European Space-Ships accommodate up to 163 guests, while Scenic emphasizes all-inclusive dining, beverages, excursions and personalized service.
                    </p>

                        Riverside takes a different approach, with a particularly strong emphasis on large accommodations, elevated dining, personalized service, and a more intimate luxury-ship feel.
                    </p>
                            <p>
                                That makes this a particularly interesting comparison for travelers who have already narrowed their choices to the luxury end of river cruising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The right question isn't simply:
                                <br />
                                Which cruise line is better?
                                <br />
                                It's:
                                <br />
                                Which luxury river cruise gives you the experience you value most?
