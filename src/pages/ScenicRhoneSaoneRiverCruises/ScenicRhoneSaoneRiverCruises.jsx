                        A Scenic Rhône and Saône River Cruise is one of the
                        best ways to experience the food, wine, history, and
                        landscapes of southern France. While the Seine
                        introduces travelers to Paris and Normandy, and the
                        Rhine and Danube connect multiple European
                        destinations, the Rhône and Saône offer something
                        distinctly different: an immersive journey through
                        French Burgundy and Provence.

                            French vineyards, historic villages, regional
