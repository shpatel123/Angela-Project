                                Seabourn is designed around an ultra-luxury model where many expenses that can become add-ons on other cruise lines are already part of the cruise experience. Dining, premium spirits and wines, Wi-Fi, gratuities, entertainment, and a number of onboard experiences are included, while certain excursions, spa treatments, premium services and other personal expenses may cost extra.

                            not mean absolutely everything is free. The core onboard
                            experience includes a remarkably broad range of services

                            A useful way to compare luxury cruises is to look beyond
                            the advertised fare. A lower cruise fare may initially
                            appear attractive, but travelers may then add a beverage
                            package, a Wi-Fi package, daily gratuities, specialty
                            dining and premium activities — and the final price can
                            become considerably higher. Seabourn's inclusive model
                            means many of these costs are already incorporated.

                            Seabourn provides one of the more comprehensive luxury
                            cruise experiences, with dining, premium beverages,
                            Champagne, caviar, Wi-Fi, gratuities, entertainment and
                            enrichment forming the foundation of the onboard
                            experience. The biggest expenses to watch are generally
                            optional shore excursions, spa treatments, private
                            experiences, travel arrangements and personal purchases.

                                <strong>Our recommendation:</strong> Don't compare
                                Seabourn based solely on the advertised cruise fare.
                                Compare the total value of what is already included.
                                For travelers who appreciate premium dining, drinks,
                                personalized service, suite accommodation and a
                                largely cash-free onboard experience, those inclusions
                                can make Seabourn a compelling luxury cruise choice.
