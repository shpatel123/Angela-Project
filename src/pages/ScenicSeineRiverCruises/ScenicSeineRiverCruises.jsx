                        A Scenic Seine River Cruise offers a different kind
                        of European river cruise experience. Instead of
                        focusing primarily on multiple countries, a Seine
                        itinerary takes you deep into France, connecting
                        Paris with Normandy, historic towns, Impressionist
                        landscapes, French cuisine, and some of the most
                        important sites in European history.

                            cruising in one seamless journey. Depending on
                            the itinerary, a Scenic Seine cruise can take you
                            from the heart of Paris toward destinations
                            including Vernon, Giverny, Rouen, Normandy,
                            historic French towns, the D-Day landing
                            beaches, and Impressionist sites — and because
                            your ship travels with you, you can explore
                            France without repeatedly changing hotels.
