                    <p>
                        Scenic and Avalon Waterways are both excellent choices for European river cruising, <br /> but they appeal to somewhat different travelers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scenic is positioned toward travelers seeking a more all-inclusive luxury experience, personalized service, and a strong emphasis on included experiences.

                                Avalon Waterways is particularly known for its spacious Panorama Suites, open-air balconies, relaxed atmosphere, and destination-focused river cruising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So the better question isn't simply:
                                <br />
                                Which is better—Scenic or Avalon?

                                It's:
                                <br />
                                Which cruise line better matches the way you want to travel?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For travelers who prioritize luxury, included experiences, personalized service, and a highly inclusive experience, Scenic can have the advantage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
